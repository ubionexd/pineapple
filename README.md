Pineapple mod is a Quilt exclusive mod made for [QuiltMC](https://github.com/quiltmc)'s mascot: Pineapple, the pumpkin!
Pineapple's model is made by [@yanasakanadev](https://twitter.com/yanasakanadev) and modified by [ubionexd](https://github.com/ubionexd) for use as a Minecraft item and block.
This mod is currently under development, so there are no mod jars for you to try. (to try it out, you have to build it for yourself)
